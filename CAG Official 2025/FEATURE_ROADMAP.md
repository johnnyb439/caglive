# Cleared Advisory Group - Feature Implementation Roadmap

## Security First Approach
- **NO storage of sensitive clearance documents (SF-86, SSN, etc.)**
- **NO detailed clearance information beyond level (SECRET/TS)**
- Companies handle all clearance verification and sensitive data
- We focus on career connections, not clearance processing

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

### 1. Live Chat Support System
**Implementation**: Intercom or Crisp.chat
- AI chatbot for 24/7 basic questions
- Human advisors during business hours (routing only)
- No sensitive data in chat
- Integration points:
  ```
  - /components/LiveChat.tsx
  - Add to layout.tsx for all pages
  ```

### 2. Job Board (Basic)
**Structure**:
```
/app/jobs/
  - page.tsx (job listings)
  - [id]/page.tsx (job details)
  - /api/jobs/route.ts (job API)
```
**Features**:
- Filter by clearance level (PUBLIC/SECRET/TS only)
- NO storage of actual clearance details
- Direct apply links to company sites
- Partner company listings only

### 3. User Dashboard (Privacy-Focused)
**Data We Store**:
- Name, email, phone
- General clearance level (not specifics)
- Skills and certifications
- Career preferences
**Data We DON'T Store**:
- SSN, DOB, or PII
- Clearance investigation details
- SF-86 information
- Polygraph specifics

## Phase 2: Engagement (Weeks 5-8)

### 4. Clearance Tracker (Modified for Privacy)
**What We Track**:
- General timeline reminders (not specific dates)
- CE training hours (just numbers)
- Career milestones
**What We DON'T Track**:
- Investigation dates
- Adjudication details
- Personal history

### 5. Skills Assessment Platform
```
/app/assessments/
  - page.tsx (assessment list)
  - [skill]/page.tsx (take assessment)
  - /api/assessments/route.ts
```
**Assessments**:
- Network fundamentals
- Security basics
- Cloud concepts
- Help desk scenarios
- Results stored as scores only

### 6. AI Resume Builder
**Approach**:
- Process resumes in-memory only
- No permanent storage of documents
- Export directly to user's device
- Military translation API (no data retention)

## Phase 3: Community (Weeks 9-12)

### 7. Networking Hub
**Privacy Features**:
- Optional anonymous profiles
- Clearance level badges (general only)
- No specific unit/deployment info shared
- Encrypted messaging

### 8. Virtual Events Platform
**Implementation**: Integrate with Zoom or custom WebRTC
```
/app/events/
  - page.tsx (event calendar)
  - [id]/page.tsx (event details)
  - live/page.tsx (streaming page)
```

### 9. Mobile App
**Tech Stack**: React Native or Flutter
**Security**:

## Phase 4: Intelligence (Weeks 13-16)

### 10. Job Match Algorithm
**Matching Criteria**:

- Location preferences
- Skill matches
- Salary expectations
- NO specific clearance details

### 11. Analytics Dashboard

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema (PostgreSQL)
```sql
-- Users table (minimal PII)
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  clearance_level ENUM('NONE', 'PUBLIC', 'SECRET', 'TS'),
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- NO storage of:
-- SSN, DOB, addresses
-- Clearance details
-- Investigation info
-- SF-86 data
```

### API Structure
```
/api/
  ├── auth/          # NextAuth.js
  ├── users/         # Profile management
  ├── jobs/          # Job listings
  ├── chat/          # Chat integration
  ├── assessments/   # Skills tests
  └── events/        # Virtual events
```

### Security Measures

3. **Access Control**: Role-based permissions
